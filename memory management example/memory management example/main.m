//probabely you can not run this program
//to run this program first you have to make your project ARC -> NO
//in ARC mode you can not use manual reference counting...
//but if you want to deliver a product for iOS 4.0 and above you can definitely use ARC.

//project -> Build Settings -> Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting -> make it (NO/YES)
