//typedef and #define are both the same but only a different is
//The typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only
//whereas #define can be used to define alias for values as well,
//like you can define 1 as ONE, etc.

#define TRUE  1
#define FALSE 0

//this is how we can use typedef for a struct
