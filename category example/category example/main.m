// A category can be declared for any class, even if you don't have the original implementation source code.

// Any methods that you declare in a category will be available to all instances of the original class, as well as any subclasses of the original class.

// At runtime, there's no difference between a method added by a category and one that is implemented by the original class.

#import "Person.h"

//this will added a function with NSString class
//then all the NSString object will have this method/property
//though we dont have the actual code of NSString class but we can add method to it.

//suppose we have a person class and some method in it
//but now we need some more method of that class
//so we now add those class so that every object of person class can use them.
